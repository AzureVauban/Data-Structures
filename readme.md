# containers.h

containers.h is some header file with my own verison of common data structures
for now the data assoicated with each structure is a string

## queue

this data structure uses the "first-in, first-out" approach, common examples of a Queue people encounter in the real world are waitlists for products, a list of songs that will play after the current song playing such as the "up next" feature on YT Music, or even a task manager on your device!
